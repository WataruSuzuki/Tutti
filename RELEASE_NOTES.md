# Release Notes

Tutti doesn't use semver. Breaking changes can occur on minor version bumps, but
not on revision bumps.


## 2.0.3

This version makes the built-in presenters `open` so that you can extend them.


## 2.0.2

This version cleans up the callout view class, but has no functional changes.


## 2.0.1

This version adds accessibility texts to the standard and deferred hint. If this is set, the callout hint will work well when accessibility is enabled.


## 2.0.1

This version adds accessibility texts to the standard and deferred hint. If this is set, the callout hint will work well when accessibility is enabled.


## 2.0.0

This version upgrades Tutti to Swift 5. The version contains no breaking changes.


## 1.5.0

This version has new hint and tutorial types. The `CorrectBehaviorOnboarding` is an onboarding experience that is triggered when a user performs a certain number of incorrect actions. `CorrectBehaviorHint` and `CorrectBehaviorTutorial` can be used to build user behavior-based onboarding experiences. There are, however, no demos for these new classes yet.

This version includes a bug fix by @sebbo176, that makes sure that callout hints are presented using the correct superview. This solves a problem where hints did remain on screen even when the main view controller changed.

This version has some breaking changes:

* The `DeferredHint` protocol is removed and the `StandardDeferredHint` has been renamed to `DeferredHint`. This makes the class hierarchy a lot easier to manage.
* The `DeferredTutorial` protocol is removed, and the `StandardDeferredTutorial` has been renamed to `DeferredTutorial`, just as the hints above.
* The `LocalizedTutorial` class has been removed. Instead, this functionality is now accessible by using a new `StandardTutorial` initializer.


## 1.4.0

This version removes presentation logic from hints/tutorials to their presenters. Instead of calling `present` on your hints and tutorials, now use the presenters.

The presenter protocols have also been refactored. The first parameter names are now implicit.

`HintPresenter` now has a `dismissAllHints()` function. It's implemented by some of the presenters, where applicable.


## 1.3.0

This version extends the `Hint` and `HintPresenter` protocols to make presenting a hint from a `UIBarButtonItem` possible. If you have any custom implementations of these protocols, you must extend them.

`CalloutHintPresenter` has been improved, so that it can dismiss presented hints. This fixes [issue #3](https://github.com/danielsaidi/Tutti/issues/3).


## 1.2.2

This version migrates `Tutti` to Swift 4.2 and makes it Xcode 10 ready.


## 1.2.1

In this version, the previously `public` standard deferred classes are now `open` so that you can inherit and them and override their logic in your own projects.


## 1.2.0

This is a pretty big update with some breaking changes. The most important thing to be aware of, however, is that the decision making of whether or not a hint or tutorial should be presented has been moved from the presenters to these classes.

This means that presenters are only responsible for the actual presentation from now on. They do not have any build-in decision making whatsoever. If you now ask a presenter to present a hint or tutorial, it will do so every time.

This means that if you migrate to `1.2.0`, you must modify your code to call the `present` function of your hints and tutorials, NOT your presenters. If you keep using the presenters, your hints and tutorials will always be presented.


### New features

- I have added a new `DeferredOnboarding` protocol. It lets you specify how many times `present` must be called before a hint or tutorial is actually presented.
- The `Hint` and `Tutorial` protocols have new `present` functions, which should be used from now on, if you want automated decision making to take place.
- I have added `DeferredHint` and `DeferredTutorial` protocols, that inherit the base protocols and `DeferredOnboarding`. 
- I have also added standard deferred hint and tutorial classes that inherit the standard non-deferred base classes.
- The `Onboarding` protocol has a new `shouldBePresented` prop that indicates if an onboarding item should be presented or not. It's implemented by the standard classes and overridden by the new standard deferred classes as well.


### Breaking changes

- The decision whether or not a hint/tutorial should be presented has been moved from the presenters to the hint and tutorials. You must use the `present` of the hints and tutorials instead of the presenters from now on.
- The presenter `present` functions don't have return values anymore, since they will always present the provided hint/tutorial.


### Deprecated members

- The `LocalizedTutorial` class has been deprecated and will be deleted the next time Tutti is bumped to a new minor version. Instead, use the localization-based `StandardTutorial` initializer, which does the same thing.
